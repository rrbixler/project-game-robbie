# The Makings of the Game

Welcome to the story behind my game

## Technologies Used:

HTML
CSS - Bootstrap
JavaScript
JQuery

## Documentation Process/ Planning:

1. Set up initial HTML elements and visual game board with bootstrap
2. Write game logic for making a move on the board
3. Write game logic for keeping score
4. write authentication files,
5. write api files,
6. finish last minute details
7. Style the app with fonts, bootstrap elements, colors etc.

I was so focused on getting the game to actually function that I didnt have a
lot of time for number 7 of my plan.  The other six basically happened in that
order.  I no doubt ran into problems and most of them were daunting, but i think
my main strategy to overcoming those problems was to check the issues cue and
search the closed issues for keywords that i thought were related to my problem.
Also talking to people in the class who were having the same problems, or
opening my own issue helped to target my specific problem.  Every time i had a
breakthrough moment, I felt like i was ready to solve any problem, but then
I would have to figure out something else in my code to work and that was basically
the cycle that occured and is still occuring right now.  I think with my problem
solving strategy, googling the problem will sometimes help, also console-logging
your way to success sometimes was the key.  I tended to prefer to test every
possible code I could think of until hours later something ended up kind of working.

## Unsolved Problems:

One unsolved problem I wil try to fix for the future is hiding the text that
shows who won and the text that shows whos turn is up next, if the user signs
out mid-turn.

## WireFrames and User Stories:

1. As a developer, i want to create a sign on page so that the game can begin.
2. As a developer, i want to create an interesting game experience so that the user wants to keep playing.
3. As a user, i want the game to function nearly perfectly so I dont get confused
4. As a developer, I want the user to be happy with their game experience
